# ml_projects(Bio-Signal Analysis for Smoking)
Data: The dataset used in this project contains bio-signal data and labels indicating whether an individual is a smoker or not. The data is stored in the data/ directory.

Usage Data Exploration: You can examine the distributions of the features, check for missing values, and visualize relationships between variables.

Data Preprocessing:This step involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, normalizing/standardizing features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Feature Engineering: It allows you to extract new features from the raw data to improve the model's performance.

Model Training:It contains code to train various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM). You can adjust hyperparameters and select the best-performing model based on cross-validation scores.

Model Evaluation: It evaluate the model's performance on the test set. This script calculates metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC and generates plots for further analysis.

*Results: *The trained model, along with evaluation results and visualizations, are saved in the results/ directory.

Model Performance After training and evaluating different models, [mention the model that performed the best], which achieved an accuracy of [accuracy score] on the test set. The model's AUC-ROC score was [AUC-ROC score], indicating good discrimination between smokers and non-smokers.

Conclusion This project demonstrates the use of machine learning to predict the presence of smoking in individuals based on bio-signals. The trained model can be integrated into the company's system to assist in health assessments and personalized recommendations.

Future Work Experiment with more advanced models like XGBoost or neural networks. Collect more data to improve model robustness. Implement real-time prediction and monitoring.
