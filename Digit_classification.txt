Digit Classification using LDA on the load_digits Dataset
Overview:
This project involves using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to classify handwritten digits from the well-known load_digits dataset. The objective is to apply LDA to reduce the dimensionality of the data while maintaining as much discriminative information as possible, and then use the transformed features to build a classification model.

Problem Statement
Handwritten digit recognition is a classic problem in machine learning and computer vision. The load_digits dataset contains images of digits (0 through 9), and the task is to classify these images correctly. This project demonstrates how LDA can be used for both dimensionality reduction and classification to achieve this goal.

Data Loading and Preprocessing: It handles loading the load_digits dataset and preprocessing the data. This includes scaling and preparing the dataset for LDA.

Applying LDA and Training the Model: It performs Linear Discriminant Analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. It then trains a classification model (such as Logistic Regression or another classifier) on the LDA-transformed features.

Model Evaluation:It evaluates the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices. It provides insights into how well the model can classify the digits after dimensionality reduction.

Visualization:It generates plots to visualize the LDA components and the separation of the classes in the reduced-dimensionality space.


After applying LDA, the classifier trained on the transformed features achieves an accuracy of 92% on the test set. The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics, and the results indicate that LDA effectively reduces dimensionality while preserving the discriminative power needed for accurate classification.

Results and VisualizationsThe results/ directory contains:

Model Metrics: Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualizations: Plots of the LDA components and class separations in the reduced feature space.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the application of Linear Discriminant Analysis for dimensionality reduction and classification on the load_digits dataset. The results show that LDA can be an effective technique for improving classification performance by reducing feature dimensionality while preserving important class information.
