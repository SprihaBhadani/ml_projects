Netflix Movie Recommendation System Using SVD
Overview:
This project involves building a movie recommendation system for Netflix using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a popular matrix factorization technique. The goal is to predict user ratings for movies they haven't watched yet, based on the patterns learned from the existing user-movie rating matrix.

Problem Statement
Netflix aims to provide personalized movie recommendations to its users by leveraging data on their past viewing behavior. The challenge is to predict how a user might rate a movie they haven't seen yet, allowing Netflix to recommend movies that users are likely to enjoy. This project uses SVD to decompose the user-movie rating matrix and predict missing ratings, thus creating a robust recommendation system.

Usage

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Use the data_preprocessing.py script to load the user-movie rating dataset and preprocess it. This step includes handling missing values, normalizing ratings, and splitting the data into training and test sets.
Applying SVD and Building the Model:

It applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to factorize the user-movie rating matrix into three matrices. These matrices represent the latent factors of users and movies, which are then used to predict missing ratings.

Model Evaluation:This script calculates Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on the test set to assess the accuracy of the predicted ratings.

Generating Recommendations:It allows you to generate personalized movie recommendations for users. By using the decomposed matrices, the script predicts ratings for all unseen movies for a given user and suggests the top-rated ones.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) can be used to build an effective movie recommendation system for Netflix. By factorizing the user-movie rating matrix, the model can predict how users might rate unseen movies and generate personalized recommendations.

Future Work
Experiment with more advanced models like SVD++ or Matrix Factorization with Alternating Least Squares (ALS).
Integrate additional features such as movie genres, user demographics, and timestamps to improve recommendations.
Deploy the recommendation system as a web application.
