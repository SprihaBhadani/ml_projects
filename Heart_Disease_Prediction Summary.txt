Project Summary: Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data, including clinical and lifestyle factors such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. Heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and early prediction can help in timely interventions and better patient outcomes.

Using various machine learning algorithms, we aim to build a predictive model that can classify patients as either likely to have heart disease or not, based on their medical history and health metrics. The dataset used contains relevant features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and ECG results.

Objectives:

Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Analyze and clean the heart disease dataset, handling missing values and preparing it for modeling.

Feature Engineering: Select and engineer relevant features that contribute to heart disease prediction.

Model Building and Evaluation: Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models, including K Neighbors Classifier`, `Support Vector Classifier`, `Decision Tree Classifier` and `Random Forest Classifier` to determine the most accurate predictor.

Performance Metrics: Use accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curve to evaluate the performance of the models.

Expected Outcomes:
A machine learning model capable of predicting heart disease with high accuracy.

Insights into the key factors contributing to heart disease risk.

A tool that can be potentially used in the medical field to assist in early diagnosis and personalized treatment planning.
